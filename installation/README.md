# Installation

Getting started with Orchestra Platform 3 is as much identical to getting started with Orchestra Platform 2. Therefore you need to have some minimum knowledge on [Laravel 5](http://laravel.com), [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) and [Packagist](https://packagist.org).

I would highly recommend watching [Laravel 5 Fundamentals](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-5-fundamentals) and [What's New in Laravel 5.1](https://laracasts.com/series/whats-new-in-laravel-5-1) video series from [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) in order to get familiar with Laravel 5 to understand some of the approach we use in Orchestra Platform 3.
