# Introduction

**Orchestra Platform** provide a solid base off of which to build your new web applications. It's not a CMS. Instead, it's a springboard to build off of with many of the tools you wish you had on projects but never took the time to build.

Have you had a client that wanted you to create a custom application but at the same time they're also looking to have a robust Content Management System within that same application? If you answered yes, what are your options?

* To build the application on top of WordPress (or other CMS system that you're familiar with).
* To build the application using your favourite language and framework while also integrating your own custom-built CMS components in it hoping that it's easy for your clients to use (just like how they were to use WordPress easily!).
* Or try to integrate both (which you know would be a bad idea from the start).
 
Orchestra Platform will solve this problem by creating a similar Administration Panel as you would see in WordPress wp-admin, so you can continue writing awesome code in Laravel but at the same time have CMS components ready at your disposal.
